<h3><b>ACT I</b></h3>

<h4><b>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Roderigo</span> and
<span class="charname">Iago</span>.</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly<br/>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,<br/>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
&rsquo;Sblood, but you will not hear me.<br/>
If ever I did dream of such a matter,<br/>
Abhor me.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Thou told&rsquo;st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<br/>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br/>
Off-capp&rsquo;d to him; and by the faith of man,<br/>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.<br/>
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,<br/>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,<br/>
Horribly stuff&rsquo;d with epithets of war:<br/>
And in conclusion,<br/>
Nonsuits my mediators: for &ldquo;Certes,&rdquo; says he,<br/>
&ldquo;I have already chose my officer.&rdquo;<br/>
And what was he?<br/>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br/>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br/>
A fellow almost damn&rsquo;d in a fair wife,<br/>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br/>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br/>
More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,<br/>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br/>
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice<br/>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,<br/>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br/>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,<br/>
Christian and heathen, must be belee&rsquo;d and calm&rsquo;d<br/>
By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,<br/>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br/>
And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship&rsquo;s ancient.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, there&rsquo;s no remedy. &rsquo;Tis the curse of service,<br/>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br/>
And not by old gradation, where each second<br/>
Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself<br/>
Whether I in any just term am affin&rsquo;d<br/>
To love the Moor.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I would not follow him, then.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O, sir, content you.<br/>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br/>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br/>
Cannot be truly follow&rsquo;d. You shall mark<br/>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave<br/>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br/>
Wears out his time, much like his master&rsquo;s ass,<br/>
For nought but provender, and when he&rsquo;s old, cashier&rsquo;d.<br/>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br/>
Who, trimm&rsquo;d in forms, and visages of duty,<br/>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br/>
And throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br/>
Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin&rsquo;d their coats,<br/>
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,<br/>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br/>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br/>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br/>
In following him, I follow but myself.<br/>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br/>
But seeming so for my peculiar end.<br/>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br/>
The native act and figure of my heart<br/>
In complement extern, &rsquo;tis not long after<br/>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br/>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,<br/>
If he can carry&rsquo;t thus!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Call up her father,<br/>
Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,<br/>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br/>
And though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br/>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br/>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on&rsquo;t,<br/>
As it may lose some color.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Here is her father&rsquo;s house, I&rsquo;ll call aloud.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br/>
As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br/>
Is spied in populous cities.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Awake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!<br/>
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!<br/>
Thieves, thieves!
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> <span class="charname">Brabantio</span> appears above at
a window.</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br/>
What is the matter there?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Signior, is all your family within?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Are your doors locked?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Why, wherefore ask you this?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Zounds, sir, you&rsquo;re robb&rsquo;d, for shame put on your gown,<br/>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br/>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br/>
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,<br/>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br/>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br/>
Arise, I say.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
What, have you lost your wits?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Not I. What are you?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
My name is Roderigo.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
The worser welcome.<br/>
I have charg&rsquo;d thee not to haunt about my doors;<br/>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br/>
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,<br/>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br/>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br/>
To start my quiet.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Sir, sir, sir,&mdash;
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
But thou must needs be sure<br/>
My spirit and my place have in them power<br/>
To make this bitter to thee.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Patience, good sir.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
What tell&rsquo;st thou me of robbing?<br/>
This is Venice. My house is not a grange.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Most grave Brabantio,<br/>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you.
Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you&rsquo;ll
have your daughter cover&rsquo;d with a Barbary horse; you&rsquo;ll have your
nephews neigh to you; you&rsquo;ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for
germans.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
What profane wretch art thou?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making
the beast with two backs.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Thou art a villain.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You are a senator.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,<br/>
If &rsquo;t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,<br/>
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,<br/>
At this odd-even and dull watch o&rsquo; the night,<br/>
Transported with no worse nor better guard,<br/>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br/>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:<br/>
If this be known to you, and your allowance,<br/>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.<br/>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me,<br/>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br/>
That from the sense of all civility,<br/>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.<br/>
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)<br/>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,<br/>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes<br/>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br/>
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:<br/>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br/>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br/>
For thus deluding you.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Strike on the tinder, ho!<br/>
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!<br/>
This accident is not unlike my dream,<br/>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br/>
Light, I say, light!
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit from above.</i>]</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Farewell; for I must leave you:<br/>
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place<br/>
To be produc&rsquo;d, as if I stay I shall,<br/>
Against the Moor. For I do know the state,<br/>
However this may gall him with some check,<br/>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he&rsquo;s embark&rsquo;d<br/>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br/>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br/>
Another of his fathom they have none<br/>
To lead their business. In which regard,<br/>
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,<br/>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br/>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br/>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br/>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,<br/>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Brabantio</span> with
Servants and torches.</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
It is too true an evil. Gone she is,<br/>
And what&rsquo;s to come of my despised time,<br/>
Is naught but bitterness. Now Roderigo,<br/>
Where didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)<br/>
With the Moor, say&rsquo;st thou? (Who would be a father!)<br/>
How didst thou know &rsquo;twas she? (O, she deceives me<br/>
Past thought.) What said she to you? Get more tapers,<br/>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Truly I think they are.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<br/>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters&rsquo; minds<br/>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<br/>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<br/>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br/>
Of some such thing?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!<br/>
Some one way, some another. Do you know<br/>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I think I can discover him, if you please<br/>
To get good guard, and go along with me.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Pray you lead on. At every house I&rsquo;ll call,<br/>
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!<br/>
And raise some special officers of night.<br/>
On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.

<h4><b>SCENE II. Venice. Another street.</b></h4>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Othello, Iago</span> and
Attendants with torches.</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br/>
Yet do I hold it very stuff o&rsquo; the conscience<br/>
To do no contriv&rsquo;d murder; I lack iniquity<br/>
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times<br/>
I had thought to have yerk&rsquo;d him here under the ribs.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis better as it is.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, but he prated,<br/>
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<br/>
Against your honour,<br/>
That with the little godliness I have,<br/>
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,<br/>
Are you fast married? Be assur&rsquo;d of this,<br/>
That the magnifico is much belov&rsquo;d<br/>
And hath in his effect a voice potential<br/>
As double as the duke&rsquo;s; he will divorce you,<br/>
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance<br/>
The law (with all his might to enforce it on)<br/>
Will give him cable.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Let him do his spite;<br/>
My services, which I have done the signiory,<br/>
Shall out-tongue his complaints. &rsquo;Tis yet to know,&mdash;<br/>
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,<br/>
I shall promulgate,&mdash;I fetch my life and being<br/>
From men of royal siege. And my demerits<br/>
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<br/>
As this that I have reach&rsquo;d. For know, Iago,<br/>
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<br/>
I would not my unhoused free condition<br/>
Put into circumscription and confine<br/>
For the sea&rsquo;s worth. But look, what lights come yond?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Those are the raised father and his friends:<br/>
You were best go in.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Not I; I must be found.<br/>
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul<br/>
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
By Janus, I think no.

with torches.</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
The servants of the duke and my lieutenant.<br/>
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!<br/>
What is the news?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
The duke does greet you, general,<br/>
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance<br/>
Even on the instant.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What is the matter, think you?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Something from Cyprus, as I may divine.<br/>
It is a business of some heat. The galleys<br/>
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<br/>
This very night at one another&rsquo;s heels;<br/>
And many of the consuls, rais&rsquo;d and met,<br/>
Are at the duke&rsquo;s already. You have been hotly call&rsquo;d for,<br/>
When, being not at your lodging to be found,<br/>
The senate hath sent about three several quests<br/>
To search you out.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis well I am found by you.<br/>
I will but spend a word here in the house,<br/>
And go with you.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Ancient, what makes he here?

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Holla, stand there!
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Signior, it is the Moor.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Down with him, thief!
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>They draw on both sides.</i>]</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.<br/>
Good signior, you shall more command with years<br/>
Than with your weapons.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow&rsquo;d my daughter?<br/>
Damn&rsquo;d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,<br/>
For I&rsquo;ll refer me to all things of sense,<br/>
(If she in chains of magic were not bound)<br/>
Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,<br/>
So opposite to marriage, that she shunn&rsquo;d<br/>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<br/>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<br/>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br/>
Of such a thing as thou&mdash;to fear, not to delight.<br/>
Judge me the world, if &rsquo;tis not gross in sense,<br/>
That thou hast practis&rsquo;d on her with foul charms,<br/>
Abus&rsquo;d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br/>
That weakens motion. I&rsquo;ll have&rsquo;t disputed on;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.<br/>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br/>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<br/>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.&mdash;<br/>
Lay hold upon him, if he do resist,<br/>
Subdue him at his peril.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Hold your hands,<br/>
Both you of my inclining and the rest:<br/>
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<br/>
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go<br/>
To answer this your charge?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
To prison, till fit time<br/>
Of law and course of direct session<br/>
Call thee to answer.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What if I do obey?<br/>
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,<br/>
Whose messengers are here about my side,<br/>
Upon some present business of the state,<br/>
To bring me to him?
</p>

<p>OFFICER.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true, most worthy signior,<br/>
The duke&rsquo;s in council, and your noble self,<br/>
I am sure is sent for.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
How? The duke in council?<br/>
In this time of the night? Bring him away;<br/>
Mine&rsquo;s not an idle cause. The duke himself,<br/>
Or any of my brothers of the state,<br/>
Cannot but feel this wrong as &rsquo;twere their own.<br/>
For if such actions may have passage free,<br/>
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

<span class="charname">Senators</span> sitting at a table; Officers attending.</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
There is no composition in these news<br/>
That gives them credit.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
Indeed, they are disproportion&rsquo;d;<br/>
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
And mine a hundred and forty.
</p>

<p>SECOND SENATOR<br/>
And mine two hundred:<br/>
But though they jump not on a just account,<br/>
(As in these cases, where the aim reports,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis oft with difference,) yet do they all confirm<br/>
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Nay, it is possible enough to judgement:<br/>
I do not so secure me in the error,<br/>
But the main article I do approve<br/>
In fearful sense.
</p>

<p>SAILOR.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
</p>

<p>OFFICER.<br/>
A messenger from the galleys.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Sailor</span>.</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Now,&mdash;what&rsquo;s the business?
</p>

<p>SAILOR.<br/>
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,<br/>
So was I bid report here to the state<br/>
By Signior Angelo.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
How say you by this change?
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
This cannot be<br/>
By no assay of reason. &rsquo;Tis a pageant<br/>
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<br/>
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;<br/>
And let ourselves again but understand<br/>
That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br/>
So may he with more facile question bear it,<br/>
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br/>
But altogether lacks the abilities<br/>
That Rhodes is dress&rsquo;d in. If we make thought of this,<br/>
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful<br/>
To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br/>
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,<br/>
To wake and wage a danger profitless.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Nay, in all confidence, he&rsquo;s not for Rhodes.
</p>

<p>OFFICER.<br/>
Here is more news.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Messenger</span>.</p>

<p>MESSENGER.<br/>
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,<br/>
Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,<br/>
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
</p>

<p>MESSENGER.<br/>
Of thirty sail, and now they do re-stem<br/>
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance<br/>
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,<br/>
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,<br/>
With his free duty recommends you thus,<br/>
And prays you to believe him.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.<br/>
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
He&rsquo;s now in Florence.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Brabantio, Othello, Iago,
Roderigo</span> and Officers.</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you<br/>
Against the general enemy Ottoman.<br/>
[<i>To Brabantio.</i>] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior,<br/>
We lack&rsquo;d your counsel and your help tonight.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me.<br/>
Neither my place, nor aught I heard of business<br/>
Hath rais&rsquo;d me from my bed, nor doth the general care<br/>
Take hold on me; for my particular grief<br/>
Is of so flood-gate and o&rsquo;erbearing nature<br/>
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows,<br/>
And it is still itself.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
My daughter! O, my daughter!
</p>

<p>DUKE and SENATORS.<br/>
Dead?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Ay, to me.<br/>
She is abused, stol&rsquo;n from me, and corrupted<br/>
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<br/>
For nature so preposterously to err,<br/>
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,<br/>
Sans witchcraft could not.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Whoe&rsquo;er he be, that in this foul proceeding,<br/>
Hath thus beguil&rsquo;d your daughter of herself,<br/>
And you of her, the bloody book of law<br/>
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter,<br/>
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son<br/>
Stood in your action.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Humbly I thank your grace.<br/>
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now it seems<br/>
Your special mandate for the state affairs<br/>
Hath hither brought.
</p>

<p>ALL.<br/>
We are very sorry for &rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
[<i>To Othello.</i>] What, in your own part, can you say to this?
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Nothing, but this is so.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br/>
My very noble and approv&rsquo;d good masters:<br/>
That I have ta&rsquo;en away this old man&rsquo;s daughter,<br/>
It is most true; true, I have married her.<br/>
The very head and front of my offending<br/>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br/>
And little bless&rsquo;d with the soft phrase of peace;<br/>
For since these arms of mine had seven years&rsquo; pith,<br/>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us&rsquo;d<br/>
Their dearest action in the tented field,<br/>
And little of this great world can I speak,<br/>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<br/>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br/>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<br/>
I will a round unvarnish&rsquo;d tale deliver<br/>
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what charms,<br/>
What conjuration, and what mighty magic,<br/>
(For such proceeding I am charged withal)<br/>
I won his daughter.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
A maiden never bold:<br/>
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion<br/>
Blush&rsquo;d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,<br/>
Of years, of country, credit, everything,<br/>
To fall in love with what she fear&rsquo;d to look on!<br/>
It is judgement maim&rsquo;d and most imperfect<br/>
That will confess perfection so could err<br/>
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br/>
To find out practices of cunning hell,<br/>
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again,<br/>
That with some mixtures powerful o&rsquo;er the blood,<br/>
Or with some dram conjur&rsquo;d to this effect,<br/>
He wrought upon her.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
To vouch this is no proof;<br/>
Without more wider and more overt test<br/>
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<br/>
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
But, Othello, speak:<br/>
Did you by indirect and forced courses<br/>
Subdue and poison this young maid&rsquo;s affections?<br/>
Or came it by request, and such fair question<br/>
As soul to soul affordeth?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I do beseech you,<br/>
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,<br/>
And let her speak of me before her father.<br/>
If you do find me foul in her report,<br/>
The trust, the office I do hold of you,<br/>
Not only take away, but let your sentence<br/>
Even fall upon my life.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Fetch Desdemona hither.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Ancient, conduct them, you best know the place.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Iago</span> and Attendants.</i>]</p>

<p>
And till she come, as truly as to heaven<br/>
I do confess the vices of my blood,<br/>
So justly to your grave ears I&rsquo;ll present<br/>
How I did thrive in this fair lady&rsquo;s love,<br/>
And she in mine.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Say it, Othello.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Her father lov&rsquo;d me, oft invited me,<br/>
Still question&rsquo;d me the story of my life,<br/>
From year to year&mdash;the battles, sieges, fortunes,<br/>
That I have pass&rsquo;d.<br/>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days<br/>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it,<br/>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br/>
Of moving accidents by flood and field;<br/>
Of hair-breadth scapes i&rsquo; th&rsquo; imminent deadly breach;<br/>
Of being taken by the insolent foe,<br/>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,<br/>
And portance in my traveler&rsquo;s history,<br/>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br/>
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,<br/>
It was my hint to speak,&mdash;such was the process;<br/>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br/>
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads<br/>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear<br/>
Would Desdemona seriously incline.<br/>
But still the house affairs would draw her thence,<br/>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br/>
She&rsquo;d come again, and with a greedy ear<br/>
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,<br/>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br/>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br/>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br/>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br/>
But not intentively. I did consent,<br/>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br/>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br/>
That my youth suffer&rsquo;d. My story being done,<br/>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.<br/>
She swore, in faith, &rsquo;twas strange, &rsquo;twas passing
strange;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas pitiful, &rsquo;twas wondrous pitiful.<br/>
She wish&rsquo;d she had not heard it, yet she wish&rsquo;d<br/>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank&rsquo;d me,<br/>
And bade me, if I had a friend that lov&rsquo;d her,<br/>
I should but teach him how to tell my story,<br/>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br/>
She lov&rsquo;d me for the dangers I had pass&rsquo;d,<br/>
And I lov&rsquo;d her that she did pity them.<br/>
This only is the witchcraft I have us&rsquo;d.<br/>
Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname"> Desdemona, Iago</span> and
Attendants.</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
I think this tale would win my daughter too.<br/>
Good Brabantio,<br/>
Take up this mangled matter at the best.<br/>
Men do their broken weapons rather use<br/>
Than their bare hands.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
I pray you hear her speak.<br/>
If she confess that she was half the wooer,<br/>
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame<br/>
Light on the man!&mdash;Come hither, gentle mistress:<br/>
Do you perceive in all this noble company<br/>
Where most you owe obedience?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
My noble father,<br/>
I do perceive here a divided duty:<br/>
To you I am bound for life and education.<br/>
My life and education both do learn me<br/>
How to respect you. You are the lord of duty,<br/>
I am hitherto your daughter: but here&rsquo;s my husband.<br/>
And so much duty as my mother show&rsquo;d<br/>
To you, preferring you before her father,<br/>
So much I challenge that I may profess<br/>
Due to the Moor my lord.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
God be with you! I have done.<br/>
Please it your grace, on to the state affairs.<br/>
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.&mdash;<br/>
Come hither, Moor:<br/>
I here do give thee that with all my heart<br/>
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<br/>
I would keep from thee.&mdash;For your sake, jewel,<br/>
I am glad at soul I have no other child,<br/>
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<br/>
To hang clogs on them.&mdash;I have done, my lord.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,<br/>
Which as a grise or step may help these lovers<br/>
Into your favour.<br/>
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<br/>
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br/>
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br/>
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br/>
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes,<br/>
Patience her injury a mockery makes.<br/>
The robb&rsquo;d that smiles steals something from the thief;<br/>
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,<br/>
We lose it not so long as we can smile;<br/>
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears<br/>
But the free comfort which from thence he hears;<br/>
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br/>
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br/>
These sentences to sugar or to gall,<br/>
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:<br/>
But words are words; I never yet did hear<br/>
That the bruis&rsquo;d heart was pierced through the ear.<br/>
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the
fortitude of the place is best known to you. And though we have there a
substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of
effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
expedition.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<br/>
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<br/>
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize<br/>
A natural and prompt alacrity<br/>
I find in hardness, and do undertake<br/>
This present wars against the Ottomites.<br/>
Most humbly, therefore, bending to your state,<br/>
I crave fit disposition for my wife,<br/>
Due reference of place and exhibition,<br/>
With such accommodation and besort<br/>
As levels with her breeding.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
If you please,<br/>
Be&rsquo;t at her father&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not have it so.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Nor I.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Nor I. I would not there reside,<br/>
To put my father in impatient thoughts,<br/>
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<br/>
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear,<br/>
And let me find a charter in your voice<br/>
T&rsquo; assist my simpleness.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
What would you, Desdemona?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
That I did love the Moor to live with him,<br/>
My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br/>
May trumpet to the world: my heart&rsquo;s subdued<br/>
Even to the very quality of my lord.<br/>
I saw Othello&rsquo;s visage in his mind,<br/>
And to his honours and his valiant parts<br/>
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br/>
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br/>
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br/>
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,<br/>
And I a heavy interim shall support<br/>
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Let her have your voice.<br/>
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not<br/>
To please the palate of my appetite,<br/>
Nor to comply with heat, the young affects<br/>
In me defunct, and proper satisfaction,<br/>
But to be free and bounteous to her mind.<br/>
And heaven defend your good souls that you think<br/>
I will your serious and great business scant<br/>
For she is with me. No, when light-wing&rsquo;d toys<br/>
Of feather&rsquo;d Cupid seel with wanton dullness<br/>
My speculative and offic&rsquo;d instruments,<br/>
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<br/>
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<br/>
And all indign and base adversities<br/>
Make head against my estimation.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Be it as you shall privately determine,<br/>
Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,<br/>
And speed must answer it.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
You must away tonight.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
With all my heart.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
At nine i&rsquo; the morning here we&rsquo;ll meet again.<br/>
Othello, leave some officer behind,<br/>
And he shall our commission bring to you,<br/>
With such things else of quality and respect<br/>
As doth import you.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
So please your grace, my ancient,<br/>
A man he is of honesty and trust,<br/>
To his conveyance I assign my wife,<br/>
With what else needful your good grace shall think<br/>
To be sent after me.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Let it be so.<br/>
Good night to everyone. [<i>To Brabantio.</i>] And, noble signior,<br/>
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,<br/>
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
</p>

<p>FIRST SENATOR.<br/>
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
</p>

<p>BRABANTIO.<br/>
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:<br/>
She has deceiv&rsquo;d her father, and may thee.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Duke,</span> Senators,
Officers, &amp;c.</i>]</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,<br/>
My Desdemona must I leave to thee.<br/>
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her,<br/>
And bring them after in the best advantage.&mdash;<br/>
Come, Desdemona, I have but an hour<br/>
Of love, of worldly matters, and direction,<br/>
To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Othello</span> and
<span class="charname">Desdemona</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Iago&mdash;
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
What sayst thou, noble heart?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
What will I do, thinkest thou?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, go to bed and sleep.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I will incontinently drown myself.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman!
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a
prescription to die when death is our physician.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years, and
since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the
love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my
virtue to amend it.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Virtue! a fig! &rsquo;Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are
gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles
or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of
herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or
manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise
another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging
motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this, that you
call love, to be a sect, or scion.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
It cannot be.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man.
Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend,
and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I
could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the
wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse.
It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the
Moor,&mdash;put money in thy purse,&mdash;nor he his to her. It was a violent
commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&mdash;put but
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse
with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him
shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is
sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have
change, she must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn
thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou
canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a
supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell,
thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! It is
clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee
again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less
reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold
him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the
womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will
have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Where shall we meet i&rsquo; the morning?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
At my lodging.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll be with thee betimes.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
What say you?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
No more of drowning, do you hear?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I am changed. I&rsquo;ll sell all my land.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.<br/>
For I mine own gain&rsquo;d knowledge should profane<br/>
If I would time expend with such a snipe<br/>
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,<br/>
And it is thought abroad that &rsquo;twixt my sheets<br/>
He has done my office. I know not if &rsquo;t be true,<br/>
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br/>
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well,<br/>
The better shall my purpose work on him.<br/>
Cassio&rsquo;s a proper man. Let me see now,<br/>
To get his place, and to plume up my will<br/>
In double knavery. How, how? Let&rsquo;s see.<br/>
After some time, to abuse Othello&rsquo;s ear<br/>
That he is too familiar with his wife.<br/>
He hath a person and a smooth dispose,<br/>
To be suspected, fram&rsquo;d to make women false.<br/>
The Moor is of a free and open nature<br/>
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br/>
And will as tenderly be led by the nose<br/>
As asses are.<br/>
I have&rsquo;t. It is engender&rsquo;d. Hell and night<br/>
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world&rsquo;s light.

<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN.<br/>
News, lads! Our wars are done.<br/>
The desperate tempest hath so bang&rsquo;d the Turks<br/>
That their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice<br/>
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance<br/>
On most part of their fleet.
</p>

<p>MONTANO.<br/>
How? Is this true?
</p>

<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN.<br/>
The ship is here put in,<br/>
A Veronessa; Michael Cassio,<br/>
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<br/>
Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,<br/>
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
</p>

<p>MONTANO.<br/>
I am glad on&rsquo;t. &rsquo;Tis a worthy governor.
</p>

<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN.<br/>
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort<br/>
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,<br/>
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted<br/>
With foul and violent tempest.
</p>

<p>MONTANO.<br/>
Pray heavens he be;<br/>
For I have serv&rsquo;d him, and the man commands<br/>
Like a full soldier. Let&rsquo;s to the sea-side, ho!<br/>
As well to see the vessel that&rsquo;s come in<br/>
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<br/>
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue<br/>
An indistinct regard.

For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
</p>

<p>MONTANO.<br/>
Is he well shipp&rsquo;d?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>

You would have enough.

Alas, she has no speech.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
In faith, too much.<br/>
I find it still when I have list to sleep.<br/>
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,<br/>
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,<br/>
And chides with thinking.
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
You have little cause to say so.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,<br/>
Bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens,<br/>
Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,<br/>
Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.<br/>
You rise to play, and go to bed to work.

You shall not write my praise.

No, let me not.
</p>

What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?
</p>

O gentle lady, do not put me to&rsquo;t,<br/>
For I am nothing if not critical.
</p>

Come on, assay.&mdash;There&rsquo;s one gone to the harbour?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ay, madam.

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I am not merry, but I do beguile<br/>
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.&mdash;<br/>
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I am about it, but indeed, my invention<br/>
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,<br/>
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,<br/>
And thus she is deliver&rsquo;d.<br/>
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<br/>
The one&rsquo;s for use, the other useth it.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Well prais&rsquo;d! How if she be black and witty?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,<br/>
She&rsquo;ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Worse and worse.
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
How if fair and foolish?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
She never yet was foolish that was fair,<br/>
For even her folly help&rsquo;d her to an heir.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i&rsquo; the alehouse. What
miserable praise hast thou for her that&rsquo;s foul and foolish?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
There&rsquo;s none so foul and foolish thereunto,<br/>
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou
bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did
justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
She that was ever fair and never proud,<br/>
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,<br/>
Never lack&rsquo;d gold and yet went never gay,<br/>
Fled from her wish, and yet said, &ldquo;Now I may&rdquo;;<br/>
She that, being anger&rsquo;d, her revenge being nigh,<br/>
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;<br/>
She that in wisdom never was so frail<br/>
To change the cod&rsquo;s head for the salmon&rsquo;s tail;<br/>
She that could think and ne&rsquo;er disclose her mind,<br/>
See suitors following and not look behind;<br/>
She was a wight, if ever such wight were&mdash;
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
To do what?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
O most lame and impotent conclusion!&mdash;Do not learn of him, Emilia, though
he be thy husband.&mdash;How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and
liberal counsellor?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the
scholar.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said, whisper. With as
little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
her, do. I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, &rsquo;tis so,
indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been
better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are
most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed, an excellent courtesy!

News, friends, our wars are done, the Turks are drown&rsquo;d.<br/>

Honey, you shall be well desir&rsquo;d in Cyprus;<br/>

In mine own comforts.&mdash;I prithee, good Iago,<br/>

Does challenge much respect.&mdash;Come, Desdemona,<br/>

</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Othello, Desdemona</span>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be&rsquo;st
valiant&mdash;as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in
their natures more than is native to them&mdash;list me. The lieutenant
tonight watches on the court of guard: first, I must tell thee
this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
With him? Why, &rsquo;tis not possible.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence
she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her fantastical lies.
And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy discreet heart think it.
Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame
it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in
years, manners, and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want
of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature
will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir, this
granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who stands so
eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble;
no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection?
Why, none, why, none! A slipper and subtle knave, a finder out of occasions;
that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage
never present itself: a devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young,
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after. A
pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I cannot believe that in her, she is full of most blessed condition.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Blest fig&rsquo;s end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been
blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not
see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Lechery, by this hand. An index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and
foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths
embrac&rsquo;d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities
so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the
incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me. I have brought you
from Venice. Watch you tonight. For the command, I&rsquo;ll lay&rsquo;t upon
you. Cassio knows you not. I&rsquo;ll not be far from you. Do you find some
occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his
discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Well.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Sir, he is rash, and very sudden in choler, and haply with his truncheon may
strike at you: provoke him that he may, for even out of that will I cause
these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste
again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to
your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment
most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our
prosperity.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries
ashore. Farewell.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Adieu.

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br/>
That she loves him, &rsquo;tis apt, and of great credit:<br/>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br/>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature;<br/>
And, I dare think, he&rsquo;ll prove to Desdemona<br/>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,<br/>
Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure<br/>
I stand accountant for as great a sin)<br/>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<br/>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br/>
Hath leap&rsquo;d into my seat. The thought whereof<br/>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,<br/>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br/>
Till I am even&rsquo;d with him, wife for wife,<br/>
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br/>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br/>
That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br/>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br/>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br/>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb<br/>
(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)<br/>
Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me<br/>
For making him egregiously an ass<br/>
And practicing upon his peace and quiet<br/>
Even to madness. &rsquo;Tis here, but yet confus&rsquo;d.<br/>

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.<br/>
The gravity and stillness of your youth<br/>
The world hath noted, and your name is great<br/>
In mouths of wisest censure: what&rsquo;s the matter,<br/>
That you unlace your reputation thus,<br/>
And spend your rich opinion for the name<br/>
Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.

Your officer, Iago, can inform you,<br/>
While I spare speech, which something now offends me,<br/>
Of all that I do know; nor know I aught<br/>
By me that&rsquo;s said or done amiss this night,<br/>
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br/>
And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br/>
When violence assails us.
</p>

My blood begins my safer guides to rule,<br/>
And passion, having my best judgement collied,<br/>
Assays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,<br/>
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br/>
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br/>
How this foul rout began, who set it on,<br/>
And he that is approv&rsquo;d in this offence,<br/>
Though he had twinn&rsquo;d with me, both at a birth,<br/>
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,<br/>
Yet wild, the people&rsquo;s hearts brimful of fear,<br/>
To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br/>
In night, and on the court and guard of safety?<br/>
&rsquo;Tis monstrous. Iago, who began&rsquo;t?
</p>

<p>MONTANO.<br/>
If partially affin&rsquo;d, or leagu&rsquo;d in office,<br/>
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br/>
Thou art no soldier.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Touch me not so near.<br/>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br/>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.<br/>
Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br/>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:<br/>
Montano and myself being in speech,<br/>
There comes a fellow crying out for help,<br/>
And Cassio following him with determin&rsquo;d sword,<br/>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br/>
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.<br/>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br/>
Lest by his clamour (as it so fell out)<br/>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<br/>
Outran my purpose: and I return&rsquo;d the rather<br/>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<br/>
And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight<br/>
I ne&rsquo;er might say before. When I came back,<br/>
(For this was brief) I found them close together,<br/>
At blow and thrust, even as again they were<br/>
When you yourself did part them.<br/>
More of this matter cannot I report.<br/>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget;<br/>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br/>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br/>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv&rsquo;d<br/>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<br/>
Which patience could not pass.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>

Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee,<br/>
But never more be officer of mine.

Ay, past all surgery.

Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost
the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago,
my reputation!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is
more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition, oft got without merit and lost without deserving. You have lost no
reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there
are ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his mood, a
punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he&rsquo;s
yours.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so
slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and
squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one&rsquo;s own shadow? O
thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call
thee devil!

What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I know not.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Is&rsquo;t possible?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing
wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! That we should with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause,
transform ourselves into beasts!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath. One
unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition
of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but since
it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as
many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup
is unbless&rsquo;d, and the ingredient is a devil.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used. Exclaim
no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I have well approved it, sir.&mdash;I drunk!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I&rsquo;ll tell you what
you shall do. Our general&rsquo;s wife is now the general; I may say so in this
respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation,
mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her.
Importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind,
so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do
more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband
entreat her to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
</p>

You advise me well.

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
</p>

Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me
here.

To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br/>

</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband<br/>
As if the cause were his.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
O, that&rsquo;s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,<br/>
But I will have my lord and you again<br/>
As friendly as you were.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Bounteous madam,<br/>
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<br/>
He&rsquo;s never anything but your true servant.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I know&rsquo;t. I thank you. You do love my lord.<br/>
You have known him long; and be you well assur&rsquo;d<br/>
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off<br/>
Than in a politic distance.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Ay, but, lady,<br/>
That policy may either last so long,<br/>
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<br/>
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<br/>
That, I being absent, and my place supplied,<br/>
My general will forget my love and service.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here<br/>
I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,<br/>
If I do vow a friendship, I&rsquo;ll perform it<br/>
To the last article. My lord shall never rest,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;<br/>
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<br/>
I&rsquo;ll intermingle everything he does<br/>
With Cassio&rsquo;s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,<br/>
For thy solicitor shall rather die<br/>
Than give thy cause away.

Madam, here comes my lord.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Madam, I&rsquo;ll take my leave.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why, stay, and hear me speak.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Madam, not now. I am very ill at ease,<br/>
Unfit for mine own purposes.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Well, do your discretion.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ha, I like not that.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What dost thou say?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nothing, my lord; or if&mdash;I know not what.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it,<br/>
That he would steal away so guilty-like,<br/>
Seeing you coming.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I do believe &rsquo;twas he.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
How now, my lord?<br/>
I have been talking with a suitor here,<br/>
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Who is&rsquo;t you mean?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br/>
If I have any grace or power to move you,<br/>
His present reconciliation take;<br/>
For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br/>
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br/>
I have no judgement in an honest face.<br/>
I prithee call him back.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Went he hence now?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Ay, sooth; so humbled<br/>
That he hath left part of his grief with me<br/>
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Not now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
But shall&rsquo;t be shortly?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
The sooner, sweet, for you.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Shall&rsquo;t be tonight at supper?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
No, not tonight.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Tomorrow dinner then?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I shall not dine at home;<br/>
I meet the captains at the citadel.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,<br/>
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn.<br/>
I prithee name the time, but let it not<br/>
Exceed three days. In faith, he&rsquo;s penitent;<br/>
And yet his trespass, in our common reason,<br/>
(Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<br/>
Out of their best) is not almost a fault<br/>
To incur a private check. When shall he come?<br/>
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<br/>
What you would ask me, that I should deny,<br/>
Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,<br/>
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br/>
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br/>
Hath ta&rsquo;en your part, to have so much to do<br/>
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Prithee no more. Let him come when he will;<br/>
I will deny thee nothing.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why, this is not a boon;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br/>
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br/>
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br/>
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<br/>
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br/>
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,<br/>
And fearful to be granted.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I will deny thee nothing.<br/>
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br/>
To leave me but a little to myself.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Shall I deny you? No, farewell, my lord.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Farewell, my Desdemona. I&rsquo;ll come to thee straight.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.<br/>
Whate&rsquo;er you be, I am obedient.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit with <span class="charname">Emilia</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,<br/>
But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,<br/>
Chaos is come again.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My noble lord,&mdash;
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What dost thou say, Iago?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo&rsquo;d my lady,<br/>
Know of your love?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
But for a satisfaction of my thought.<br/>
No further harm.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Why of thy thought, Iago?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O yes, and went between us very oft.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Indeed?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern&rsquo;st thou aught in that?<br/>
Is he not honest?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Honest, my lord?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Honest? ay, honest.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My lord, for aught I know.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What dost thou think?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Think, my lord?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,<br/>
As if there were some monster in his thought<br/>
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.<br/>
I heard thee say even now, thou lik&rsquo;st not that,<br/>
When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?<br/>
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br/>
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;<br/>
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<br/>
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br/>
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<br/>
Show me thy thought.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My lord, you know I love you.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I think thou dost;<br/>
And for I know thou&rsquo;rt full of love and honesty<br/>
And weigh&rsquo;st thy words before thou giv&rsquo;st them breath,<br/>
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<br/>
For such things in a false disloyal knave<br/>
Are tricks of custom; but in a man that&rsquo;s just,<br/>
They&rsquo;re close dilations, working from the heart,<br/>
That passion cannot rule.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
For Michael Cassio,<br/>
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I think so too.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Men should be what they seem;<br/>
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Certain, men should be what they seem.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why then, I think Cassio&rsquo;s an honest man.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Nay, yet there&rsquo;s more in this:<br/>
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br/>
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<br/>
The worst of words.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Good my lord, pardon me.<br/>
Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br/>
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br/>
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:<br/>
As where&rsquo;s that palace whereinto foul things<br/>
Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure<br/>
But some uncleanly apprehensions<br/>
Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit<br/>
With meditations lawful?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br/>
If thou but think&rsquo;st him wrong&rsquo;d and mak&rsquo;st his ear<br/>
A stranger to thy thoughts.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I do beseech you,<br/>
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,<br/>
As, I confess, it is my nature&rsquo;s plague<br/>
To spy into abuses, and of my jealousy<br/>
Shapes faults that are not,&mdash;that your wisdom<br/>
From one that so imperfectly conceits,<br/>
Would take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble<br/>
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br/>
It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br/>
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,<br/>
To let you know my thoughts.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What dost thou mean?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br/>
Is the immediate jewel of their souls.<br/>
Who steals my purse steals trash. &rsquo;Tis something, nothing;<br/>
&rsquo;Twas mine, &rsquo;tis his, and has been slave to thousands.<br/>
But he that filches from me my good name<br/>
Robs me of that which not enriches him<br/>
And makes me poor indeed.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
By heaven, I&rsquo;ll know thy thoughts.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,<br/>
Nor shall not, whilst &rsquo;tis in my custody.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Ha?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;<br/>
It is the green-ey&rsquo;d monster which doth mock<br/>
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss<br/>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br/>
But O, what damned minutes tells he o&rsquo;er<br/>
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O misery!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;<br/>
But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br/>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br/>
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend<br/>
From jealousy!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Why, why is this?<br/>
Think&rsquo;st thou I&rsquo;d make a life of jealousy,<br/>
To follow still the changes of the moon<br/>
With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt<br/>
Is once to be resolv&rsquo;d: exchange me for a goat<br/>
When I shall turn the business of my soul<br/>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br/>
Matching thy inference. &rsquo;Tis not to make me jealous,<br/>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br/>
Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;<br/>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br/>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br/>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,<br/>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br/>
And on the proof, there is no more but this:<br/>
Away at once with love or jealousy!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason<br/>
To show the love and duty that I bear you<br/>
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,<br/>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br/>
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br/>
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.<br/>
I would not have your free and noble nature,<br/>
Out of self-bounty, be abus&rsquo;d. Look to&rsquo;t.<br/>
I know our country disposition well;<br/>
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks<br/>
They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience<br/>
Is not to leave undone, but keep unknown.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Dost thou say so?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
She did deceive her father, marrying you;<br/>
And when she seem&rsquo;d to shake and fear your looks,<br/>
She loved them most.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
And so she did.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, go to then.<br/>
She that so young could give out such a seeming,<br/>
To seal her father&rsquo;s eyes up close as oak,<br/>
He thought &rsquo;twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame.<br/>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br/>
For too much loving you.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I am bound to thee for ever.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I see this hath a little dash&rsquo;d your spirits.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Not a jot, not a jot.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Trust me, I fear it has.<br/>
I hope you will consider what is spoke<br/>
Comes from my love. But I do see you&rsquo;re mov&rsquo;d.<br/>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br/>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br/>
Than to suspicion.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I will not.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Should you do so, my lord,<br/>
My speech should fall into such vile success<br/>
Which my thoughts aim&rsquo;d not. Cassio&rsquo;s my worthy friend.<br/>
My lord, I see you&rsquo;re mov&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
No, not much mov&rsquo;d.<br/>
I do not think but Desdemona&rsquo;s honest.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Long live she so! And long live you to think so!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
And yet, how nature erring from itself&mdash;
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ay, there&rsquo;s the point. As, to be bold with you,<br/>
Not to affect many proposed matches,<br/>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br/>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends;<br/>
Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,<br/>
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.<br/>
But pardon me: I do not in position<br/>
Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear<br/>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,<br/>
May fall to match you with her country forms,<br/>
And happily repent.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Farewell, farewell:<br/>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;<br/>
Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
[<i>Going.</i>] My lord, I take my leave.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<br/>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
[<i>Returning.</i>] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour<br/>
To scan this thing no further. Leave it to time:<br/>
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,<br/>
For sure he fills it up with great ability,<br/>
Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,<br/>
You shall by that perceive him and his means.<br/>
Note if your lady strain his entertainment<br/>
With any strong or vehement importunity,<br/>
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,<br/>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears<br/>
(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)<br/>
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Fear not my government.
</p>

</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
This fellow&rsquo;s of exceeding honesty,<br/>
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,<br/>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br/>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br/>
I&rsquo;d whistle her off, and let her down the wind<br/>
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,<br/>
And have not those soft parts of conversation<br/>
That chamberers have, or for I am declin&rsquo;d<br/>
Into the vale of years,&mdash;yet that&rsquo;s not much&mdash;<br/>
She&rsquo;s gone, I am abus&rsquo;d, and my relief<br/>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br/>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br/>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br/>
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br/>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br/>
For others&rsquo; uses. Yet, &rsquo;tis the plague of great ones,<br/>
Prerogativ&rsquo;d are they less than the base,<br/>
&rsquo;Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<br/>
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<br/>
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes.<br/>

That she reserves it evermore about her<br/>
To kiss and talk to. I&rsquo;ll have the work ta&rsquo;en out,<br/>

What handkerchief?

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
What handkerchief?<br/>
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,<br/>
That which so often you did bid me steal.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Hast stol&rsquo;n it from her?
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
No, faith, she let it drop by negligence,<br/>
And, to the advantage, I being here, took &rsquo;t up.<br/>

I saw&rsquo;t not, thought it not, it harm&rsquo;d not me.<br/>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My noble lord,&mdash;
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br/>
Never pray more. Abandon all remorse;<br/>
On horror&rsquo;s head horrors accumulate;<br/>
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz&rsquo;d;<br/>
For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br/>
Greater than that.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O grace! O heaven defend me!<br/>
Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?<br/>
God be wi&rsquo; you. Take mine office.&mdash;O wretched fool,<br/>
That liv&rsquo;st to make thine honesty a vice!<br/>
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,<br/>
To be direct and honest is not safe.<br/>
I thank you for this profit, and from hence<br/>
I&rsquo;ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I should be wise; for honesty&rsquo;s a fool,<br/>
And loses that it works for.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
By the world,<br/>
I think my wife be honest, and think she is not.<br/>
I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll have some proof: her name, that was as fresh<br/>
As Dian&rsquo;s visage, is now begrim&rsquo;d and black<br/>
As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,<br/>
Poison or fire, or suffocating streams,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll not endure &rsquo;t. Would I were satisfied!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.<br/>
I do repent me that I put it to you.<br/>
You would be satisfied?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Would? Nay, I will.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?<br/>
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,<br/>
Behold her topp&rsquo;d?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Death and damnation! O!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br/>
To bring them to that prospect. Damn them then,<br/>
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br/>
More than their own! What then? How then?<br/>
What shall I say? Where&rsquo;s satisfaction?<br/>
It is impossible you should see this,<br/>
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br/>
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br/>
As ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,<br/>
If imputation and strong circumstances,<br/>
Which lead directly to the door of truth,<br/>
Will give you satisfaction, you may have&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Give me a living reason she&rsquo;s disloyal.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I do not like the office,<br/>
But sith I am enter&rsquo;d in this cause so far,<br/>
Prick&rsquo;d to &rsquo;t by foolish honesty and love,<br/>
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,<br/>
And being troubled with a raging tooth,<br/>
I could not sleep.<br/>
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<br/>
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.<br/>
One of this kind is Cassio:<br/>
In sleep I heard him say, &ldquo;Sweet Desdemona,<br/>
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;&rdquo;<br/>
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br/>
Cry &ldquo;O sweet creature!&rdquo; and then kiss me hard,<br/>
As if he pluck&rsquo;d up kisses by the roots,<br/>
That grew upon my lips, then laid his leg<br/>
Over my thigh, and sigh&rsquo;d and kiss&rsquo;d, and then<br/>
Cried &ldquo;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O monstrous! monstrous!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, this was but his dream.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
But this denoted a foregone conclusion.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
And this may help to thicken other proofs<br/>
That do demonstrate thinly.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll tear her all to pieces.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done,<br/>
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,<br/>
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br/>
Spotted with strawberries in your wife&rsquo;s hand?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I gave her such a one, &rsquo;twas my first gift.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I know not that: but such a handkerchief<br/>
(I am sure it was your wife&rsquo;s) did I today<br/>
See Cassio wipe his beard with.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
If it be that,&mdash;
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
If it be that, or any that was hers,<br/>
It speaks against her with the other proofs.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br/>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge!<br/>
Now do I see &rsquo;tis true. Look here, Iago;<br/>
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis gone.<br/>
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow hell!<br/>
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br/>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br/>
For &rsquo;tis of aspics&rsquo; tongues!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Yet be content.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O, blood, Iago, blood!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,<br/>
Whose icy current and compulsive course<br/>
Ne&rsquo;er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br/>
To the Propontic and the Hellespont;<br/>
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace<br/>
Shall ne&rsquo;er look back, ne&rsquo;er ebb to humble love,<br/>
Till that a capable and wide revenge<br/>
Swallow them up. Now by yond marble heaven,<br/>
In the due reverence of a sacred vow [<i>Kneels.</i>]<br/>
I here engage my words.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Do not rise yet. [<i>Kneels.</i>]<br/>
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br/>
You elements that clip us round about,<br/>
Witness that here Iago doth give up<br/>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<br/>
To wrong&rsquo;d Othello&rsquo;s service! Let him command,<br/>
And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br/>
What bloody business ever.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>They rise.</i>]</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I greet thy love,<br/>
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br/>
And will upon the instant put thee to &rsquo;t.<br/>
Within these three days let me hear thee say<br/>
That Cassio&rsquo;s not alive.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My friend is dead. &rsquo;Tis done at your request.<br/>
But let her live.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!<br/>
Come, go with me apart, I will withdraw<br/>
To furnish me with some swift means of death<br/>
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I am your own for ever.

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why, man?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
He&rsquo;s a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Go to. Where lodges he?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Can anything be made of this?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging, and say he lies
here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions and by them answer.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and
hope all will be well.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
To do this is within the compass of man&rsquo;s wit, and therefore I will
attempt the doing it.
</p>

</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
I know not, madam.

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br/>
Full of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor<br/>
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br/>
As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br/>
To put him to ill thinking.
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
Is he not jealous?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br/>
Drew all such humours from him.

I will not leave him now till Cassio<br/>
Be call&rsquo;d to him. How is&rsquo;t with you, my lord?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Well, my good lady. [<i>Aside.</i>] O, hardness to dissemble!<br/>
How do you, Desdemona?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Well, my good lord.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.<br/>
Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires<br/>
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br/>
Much castigation, exercise devout;<br/>
For here&rsquo;s a young and sweating devil here<br/>
That commonly rebels. &rsquo;Tis a good hand,<br/>
A frank one.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
You may indeed say so,<br/>
For &rsquo;twas that hand that gave away my heart.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands,<br/>
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
What promise, chuck?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.<br/>
Lend me thy handkerchief.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Here, my lord.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
That which I gave you.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I have it not about me.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Not?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
No, faith, my lord.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
That is a fault. That handkerchief<br/>
Did an Egyptian to my mother give.<br/>
She was a charmer, and could almost read<br/>
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,<br/>
&rsquo;Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br/>
Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,<br/>
Or made a gift of it, my father&rsquo;s eye<br/>
Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt<br/>
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me,<br/>
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,<br/>
To give it her. I did so; and take heed on&rsquo;t,<br/>
Make it a darling like your precious eye.<br/>
To lose&rsquo;t or give&rsquo;t away were such perdition<br/>
As nothing else could match.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Is&rsquo;t possible?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis true. There&rsquo;s magic in the web of it.<br/>
A sibyl, that had number&rsquo;d in the world<br/>
The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br/>
In her prophetic fury sew&rsquo;d the work;<br/>
The worms were hallow&rsquo;d that did breed the silk,<br/>
And it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful<br/>
Conserv&rsquo;d of maiden&rsquo;s hearts.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Indeed? Is&rsquo;t true?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Most veritable, therefore look to &rsquo;t well.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Then would to God that I had never seen &rsquo;t!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Ha? wherefore?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
</p>

Is&rsquo;t lost? is&rsquo;t gone? speak, is it out of the way?

Heaven bless us!

Say you?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
It is not lost, but what and if it were?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
How?
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I say it is not lost.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Fetch&rsquo;t, let me see &rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.<br/>
This is a trick to put me from my suit.<br/>
Pray you, let Cassio be receiv&rsquo;d again.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Come, come.<br/>
You&rsquo;ll never meet a more sufficient man.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I pray, talk me of Cassio.

Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,<br/>

There is no other way; &rsquo;tis she must do &rsquo;t,<br/>
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
How now, good Cassio, what&rsquo;s the news with you?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you<br/>
That by your virtuous means I may again<br/>
Exist, and be a member of his love,<br/>
Whom I, with all the office of my heart,<br/>
Entirely honour. I would not be delay&rsquo;d.<br/>
If my offence be of such mortal kind<br/>
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,<br/>
Nor purpos&rsquo;d merit in futurity,<br/>
Can ransom me into his love again,<br/>
But to know so must be my benefit;<br/>
So shall I clothe me in a forc&rsquo;d content,<br/>
And shut myself up in some other course<br/>
To fortune&rsquo;s alms.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,<br/>
My advocation is not now in tune;<br/>
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him<br/>
Were he in favour as in humour alter&rsquo;d.<br/>
So help me every spirit sanctified,<br/>
As I have spoken for you all my best,<br/>
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br/>
For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.<br/>
What I can do I will; and more I will<br/>
Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Is my lord angry?
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
He went hence but now,<br/>
And certainly in strange unquietness.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<br/>
When it hath blown his ranks into the air<br/>
And, like the devil, from his very arm<br/>
Puff&rsquo;d his own brother, and can he be angry?<br/>
Something of moment then. I will go meet him.<br/>
There&rsquo;s matter in&rsquo;t indeed if he be angry.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
I prithee do so.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Iago</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>Something sure of state,<br/>
Either from Venice, or some unhatch&rsquo;d practice<br/>
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br/>
Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases<br/>
Men&rsquo;s natures wrangle with inferior things,<br/>
Though great ones are their object. &rsquo;Tis even so.<br/>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br/>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br/>
Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,<br/>
Nor of them look for such observancy<br/>
As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br/>
I was (unhandsome warrior as I am)<br/>
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<br/>
But now I find I had suborn&rsquo;d the witness,<br/>
And he&rsquo;s indicted falsely.
</p>

Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,<br/>

Concerning you.
</p>

<p>DESDEMONA.<br/>
Alas the day, I never gave him cause!
</p>

<p>EMILIA.<br/>
But jealous souls will not be answer&rsquo;d so;<br/>
They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br/>
But jealous for they are jealous: &rsquo;tis a monster<br/>
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
</p>

Will you think so?

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Think so, Iago?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
What,<br/>
To kiss in private?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
An unauthoriz&rsquo;d kiss.

Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br/>
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?<br/>
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<br/>
They that mean virtuously and yet do so,<br/>
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

Thou said&rsquo;st (O, it comes o&rsquo;er my memory,<br/>

Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.

That&rsquo;s not so good now.

Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,<br/>

What? What?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Lie.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
With her?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
With her, on her, what you will.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Lie with her! lie on her!&mdash;We say lie on her when they belie
her.&mdash;Lie with her! that&rsquo;s fulsome.
Handkerchief&mdash;confessions&mdash;handkerchief! To confess, and be hanged
for his labour. First, to be hanged, and then to confess. I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some
instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
Is&rsquo;t possible?&mdash;Confess?&mdash;handkerchief?&mdash;O devil!&mdash;
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Falls in a trance.</i>]</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
What&rsquo;s the matter?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
My lord is fallen into an epilepsy.<br/>
This is his second fit. He had one yesterday.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Rub him about the temples.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
No, forbear;<br/>
The lethargy must have his quiet course.<br/>
If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by<br/>
Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:<br/>
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<br/>
He will recover straight. When he is gone,<br/>
I would on great occasion speak with you.
</p>

There&rsquo;s many a beast, then, in a populous city,<br/>
And many a civil monster.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Did he confess it?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Good sir, be a man.<br/>
Think every bearded fellow that&rsquo;s but yok&rsquo;d<br/>
May draw with you. There&rsquo;s millions now alive<br/>
That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br/>
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<br/>
O, &rsquo;tis the spite of hell, the fiend&rsquo;s arch-mock,<br/>
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<br/>
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,<br/>
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O, thou art wise, &rsquo;tis certain.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Stand you awhile apart,<br/>
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br/>
Whilst you were here o&rsquo;erwhelmed with your grief,<br/>
(A passion most unsuiting such a man)<br/>
Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,<br/>
And laid good &rsquo;scuse upon your ecstasy,<br/>
Bade him anon return, and here speak with me,<br/>
The which he promis&rsquo;d. Do but encave yourself,<br/>
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<br/>
That dwell in every region of his face;<br/>
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<br/>
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br/>
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<br/>
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,<br/>
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<br/>
And nothing of a man.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Dost thou hear, Iago?<br/>
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<br/>
But,&mdash;dost thou hear?&mdash;most bloody.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
That&rsquo;s not amiss.<br/>
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i><span class="charname">Othello</span> withdraws.</i>]</p>

<p>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br/>
A housewife that by selling her desires<br/>
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<br/>
That dotes on Cassio, (as &rsquo;tis the strumpet&rsquo;s plague<br/>
To beguile many and be beguil&rsquo;d by one.)<br/>
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain<br/>
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.

Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
The worser that you give me the addition<br/>
Whose want even kills me.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on&rsquo;t.<br/>
[<i>Speaking lower.</i>] Now, if this suit lay in Bianca&rsquo;s power,<br/>
How quickly should you speed!
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Alas, poor caitiff!

</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I never knew a woman love man so.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Alas, poor rogue! I think, i&rsquo; faith, she loves me.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Do you hear, Cassio?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Now he importunes him<br/>
To tell it o&rsquo;er. Go to, well said, well said.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
She gives it out that you shall marry her.<br/>
Do you intend it?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Ha, ha, ha!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I marry her? What? A customer? I prithee, bear some charity to my wit, do not
think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Prithee say true.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I am a very villain else.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Have you scored me? Well.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
This is the monkey&rsquo;s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her,
out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Iago beckons me. Now he begins the story.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
She was here even now. She haunts me in every place. I was the other day
talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble,
and falls thus about my neck.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Crying, &ldquo;O dear Cassio!&rdquo; as it were: his gesture imports it.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours,
but not that dog I shall throw it to.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Well, I must leave her company.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Before me! look where she comes.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bianca</span>.</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum&rsquo;d one.<br/>
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same
handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take
out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your
chamber and not know who left it there! This is some minx&rsquo;s token, and I
must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you
had it, I&rsquo;ll take out no work on&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
How now, my sweet Bianca? How now, how now?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
</p>

<p>BIANCA.<br/>
If you&rsquo;ll come to supper tonight, you may. If you will not, come when you
are next prepared for.

Yours, by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she

I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet
woman!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, you must forget that.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned tonight, for she shall not live. No,
my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world
hath not a sweeter creature. She might lie by an emperor&rsquo;s side, and
command him tasks.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Nay, that&rsquo;s not your way.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Hang her, I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle, an admirable
musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of so high and
plenteous wit and invention!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
She&rsquo;s the worse for all this.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O, a thousand, a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ay, too gentle.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Nay, that&rsquo;s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of
it, Iago!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it
touch not you, it comes near nobody.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O, &rsquo;tis foul in her.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
With mine officer!
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
That&rsquo;s fouler.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Get me some poison, Iago; this night. I&rsquo;ll not expostulate with her, lest
her body and beauty unprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath
contaminated.
</p>

Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very good.

Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me

</p>

</p>

Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin
together.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You charge me most unjustly.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
With naught but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you
have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist:
you have told me she hath received them, and returned me expectations and
comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
</p>

Well, go to, very well.

Very well, go to, I cannot go to, man, nor &rsquo;tis not very well. Nay, I say

</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Very well.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
I tell you &rsquo;tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If
she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful
solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
You have said now.
</p>

Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, now I see there&rsquo;s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do
build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest, I have
dealt most directly in thy affair.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
It hath not appeared.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and
judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have
greater reason to believe now than ever,&mdash;I mean purpose, courage, and
valour,&mdash;this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not
Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my
life.
</p>

Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in
Othello&rsquo;s place.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the fair Desdemona,
unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so
determinate as the removing of Cassio.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
How do you mean &ldquo;removing&rdquo; of him?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello&rsquo;s place: knocking out his brains.
</p>

<p>RODERIGO.<br/>
And that you would have me to do?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a
harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his honourable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out
between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to
second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at
it, but go along with me. I will show you such a necessity in his death that
you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time,
and the night grows to waste. About it.

not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns,

And pour our treasures into foreign laps;<br/>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br/>
Throwing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,<br/>
Or scant our former having in despite.<br/>
Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,<br/>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br/>
Their wives have sense like them: they see, and smell<br/>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br/>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br/>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br/>
I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<br/>
I think it doth. Is&rsquo;t frailty that thus errs?<br/>
It is so too. And have not we affections,<br/>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br/>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br/>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,<br/>
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!<br/>
It is the cause. Yet I&rsquo;ll not shed her blood,<br/>
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br/>
And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br/>
Yet she must die, else she&rsquo;ll betray more men.<br/>
Put out the light, and then put out the light:<br/>
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br/>
I can again thy former light restore,<br/>
Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,<br/>
Thou cunning&rsquo;st pattern of excelling nature,<br/>
I know not where is that Promethean heat<br/>
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck&rsquo;d thy rose,<br/>
I cannot give it vital growth again,<br/>
It must needs wither. I&rsquo;ll smell it on the tree.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Kissing her.</i>]</p>

<p>O, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br/>
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.<br/>
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br/>
And love thee after. One more, and this the last.<br/>
So sweet was ne&rsquo;er so fatal. I must weep,<br/>
But they are cruel tears. This sorrow&rsquo;s heavenly,<br/>
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

Ay, but not yet to die.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Yes, presently:<br/>
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin.<br/>

Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br/>
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

Offend you in my life,	 never lov&rsquo;d Cassio<br/>
But with such general warranty of heaven<br/>
As I might love. I never gave him token.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in &rsquo;s hand.<br/>
O perjur&rsquo;d woman, thou dost stone my heart,<br/>
And mak&rsquo;st me call what I intend to do<br/>
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice.<br/>
I saw the handkerchief.
</p>

A thousand times committed; Cassio confess&rsquo;d it,<br/>
And she did gratify his amorous works<br/>

O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak&rsquo;st of<br/>

A better never did itself sustain<br/>
Upon a soldier&rsquo;s thigh: I have seen the day<br/>
That with this little arm and this good sword<br/>
I have made my way through more impediments<br/>
Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!<br/>
Who can control his fate? &rsquo;Tis not so now.<br/>
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon&rsquo;d.<br/>
Here is my journey&rsquo;s end, here is my butt,<br/>
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br/>
Do you go back dismay&rsquo;d? &rsquo;Tis a lost fear.<br/>
Man but a rush against Othello&rsquo;s breast,<br/>
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br/>
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr&rsquo;d wench,<br/>
Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,<br/>
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br/>
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<br/>

</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
That&rsquo;s he that was Othello. Here I am.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I look down towards his feet; but that&rsquo;s a fable.<br/>
If that thou be&rsquo;st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Wounds Iago.</i>]</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>

</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
I bleed, sir, but not kill&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I am not sorry neither. I&rsquo;d have thee live,<br/>
For in my sense &rsquo;tis happiness to die.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,<br/>

What shall be said to thee?
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Why, anything;<br/>
An honourable murderer, if you will.<br/>
For naught did I in hate, but all in honour.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>

</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Ay.
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Dear general, I never gave you cause.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br/>
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br/>
Why he hath thus ensnar&rsquo;d my soul and body?
</p>

<p>IAGO.<br/>
Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.<br/>
From this time forth I never will speak word.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
What, not to pray?
</p>

<p>GRATIANO.<br/>
Torments will ope your lips.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Well, thou dost best.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall&rsquo;n,<br/>
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br/>
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,<br/>
And here another. The one of them imports<br/>
The death of Cassio, to be undertook<br/>
By Roderigo.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O villain!
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
Most heathenish and most gross!
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
Now here&rsquo;s another discontented paper,<br/>
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<br/>
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,<br/>
But that, belike, Iago in the interim<br/>
Came in and satisfied him.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O the pernicious caitiff!<br/>
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br/>
That was my wife&rsquo;s?
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
I found it in my chamber.<br/>
And he himself confess&rsquo;d but even now,<br/>
That there he dropp&rsquo;d it for a special purpose<br/>
Which wrought to his desire.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
O fool! fool! fool!
</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
There is besides in Roderigo&rsquo;s letter,<br/>
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br/>
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came<br/>
That I was cast. And even but now he spake,<br/>
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<br/>
Iago set him on.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
You must forsake this room, and go with us.<br/>
Your power and your command is taken off,<br/>
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br/>
If there be any cunning cruelty<br/>
That can torment him much and hold him long,<br/>
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br/>
Till that the nature of your fault be known<br/>
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
Soft you; a word or two before you go.<br/>
I have done the state some service, and they know&rsquo;t.<br/>
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br/>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br/>
Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,<br/>
Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak<br/>
Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;<br/>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,<br/>
Perplex&rsquo;d in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br/>
Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away<br/>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu&rsquo;d eyes,<br/>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br/>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br/>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this.<br/>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br/>
Where a malignant and a turban&rsquo;d Turk<br/>
Beat a Venetian and traduc&rsquo;d the state,<br/>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br/>
And smote him, thus.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Stabs himself.</i>]</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
O bloody period!
</p>

<p>GRATIANO.<br/>
All that&rsquo;s spoke is marr&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>OTHELLO.<br/>
I kiss&rsquo;d thee ere I kill&rsquo;d thee. No way but this,<br/>
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Falling upon Desdemona.</i>]</p>

<p>CASSIO.<br/>
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,<br/>
For he was great of heart.
</p>

<p>LODOVICO.<br/>
[<i>To Iago.</i>] O Spartan dog,<br/>
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,<br/>
Look on the tragic loading of this bed.<br/>
This is thy work. The object poisons sight,<br/>
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,<br/>
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br/>
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,<br/>
Remains the censure of this hellish villain.<br/>
The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!<br/>
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state<br/>
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
