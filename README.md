# LiteratureClock

Express the time with excerpts from books! (not an original idea, but I wanted to try) 

Currently only works for nearest hour (need more books for nearest 10 minutes/15 minutes)

### Files

* main.py: get excerpt for current hour
* scraper.py: scrapes Project Gutenberg for popular books
* tometostring.py: converts time to strings for matching
* parser.py: parses books for times
* cleanup.py, cleanup2.py: clean up books for processing
